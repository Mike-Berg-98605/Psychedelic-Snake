# Psychedelic Snake
 
This is my psychedelic take on the classic Snake game. Download the Repo and open in your browser of choice to play. 
W=North S=South A=West D=East. JavaScript is used to setup the audio triggers as well as the game board and the border of 
the game board changes colors to add the psychedelic effect.

I do not own the images or sound effects.

I recorded the background music in 2020, here's the link: https://mtberg1.bandcamp.com/track/dance-at-dusk
